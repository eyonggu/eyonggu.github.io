subtitle: Enjoy reverse engineering of Linux kernel
---

I have been using evernote to take notes when I learn new knowledge of Linux kernel, and evernote is great tool for text, however, except the short text note for such as concept/hands-on, I'm also always intested in knowing how everything is impelemented in code, it becomes not ideal to have long code notes in the tool. That's how I started with this blog on github.

In this blog, I want to explain the Linux kernel implementations for varous functions with simplified code and comments, in this way, I hope it can help you and also myself to understand how everything is implemented.
