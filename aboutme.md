subtitle: Enjoy reverse engineering of Linux kernel
---

I have been using evernote to take notes when I learn new knowledge of the Linux kernel, and evernote is a great tool for text note, however, except the short notes for such as concept/hands-on, I'm also always interested in knowing how everything is implemented in code, it becomes not ideal to have long code notes in the tool. That's why I started with this blog on github.

In this blog, I want to explain the Linux kernel implementations for varous functions with simplified code and comments, in this way, I hope it can help you and also myself to understand how everything is implemented.

I intentionally to omit to explain the knowledge/concept itself, because you can find plenty of good articles for them from other sources, I know I can't do better than those.
